<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>My name is Jaewook J. Suh.<br />
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University.<br />
I study optimization, and my advisor is <a href="http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/">Ernest K. Ryu</a>.</p>

<h1 id="current-research-interest">Current Research Interest</h1>
<p>I am interested in studying <strong>optimization</strong> based on <strong>continuous-time analysis</strong>.
My recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00771"><em>Continuous-Time Analysis of Anchor Acceleration</em></a> is accepted in NeurIPS 2023 as a poster. 
Anchor acceleration is a new acceleration mechanism for minimax optimization and fixed-point problems. 
My paper provides continuous-time analysis about anchor acceleration in an unified manner, adopting the <strong>dilated-coordinate system</strong> which was suggested in my previous paper <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/suh22a.html"><em>Continuous-Time Analysis of AGM via Conservation Laws in Dilated Coordinate Systems</em></a>. 
<!-- I am now interested in  --></p>
