# About me
My name is Jaewook J. Suh.  
I'm a Ph.D. student in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University.  
I study optimization, and my advisor is [Ernest K. Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/).


# Current Research Interest
I am interested in studying **optimization** based on **continuous-time analysis**.
My recent paper [*Continuous-Time Analysis of Anchor Acceleration*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00771) is accepted in NeurIPS 2023 as a poster. 
Anchor acceleration is a new acceleration mechanism for minimax optimization and fixed-point problems. 
My paper provides continuous-time analysis about anchor acceleration in an unified manner, adopting the **dilated-coordinate system** which was suggested in my previous paper [*Continuous-Time Analysis of AGM via Conservation Laws in Dilated Coordinate Systems*](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/suh22a.html).
